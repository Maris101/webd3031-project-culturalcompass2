# What Is Cherry Blossom Season?

Every year around Spring, the cherry blossom season in Japan begins. Hundreds of locals and tourists gather to enjoy the special and fleeting show. The blossom’s only last for a few weeks, leaving many panicking to try and grab a seat. 

It’s tradition in Japan to gather with family and friends to enjoy a picnic packed with dumplings, rice cakes, bento boxes, pickled plums and many more traditional foods. This time is important in helping strengthen bonds, and grow closer among loved ones and those that are close to your heart.

Some local hidden places that people gather to watch the blossom’s dance include:



- Sarue Park: You can get a great view of the sakura along with Tokyo Sky Tree here!
- Kiba Park: Close to Sarue Park and another great hanami place beloved by locals. The view of Tokyo Sky Tree isn’t as nice as Sarue Park.
- Kinuta Park: If you’re staying in west Tokyo, this is a great alternative to the two above. The place is HUGE but the cherry blossoms are mainly concentrated in the Family Park area, so anywhere here between the 2nd and 3rd Bridge.
- Asukayama Park: If you’re staying in north Tokyo, this is park is an absolute gem located in the charming neighborhood of Oji. Perched on top of a hill, you can either climb the stairs or take the ropeway up.
- Inokashira Park: I was pondering whether to put this in this “local places” list since it’s actually quite popular but the park itself has so many things to do and is out of the way enough that it never feels too touristy or crowded.
