# What Is Holi?

Holi, often referred to as the "Festival of Colors," is one of the most joyous and vibrant festivals celebrated in India and by Indian communities worldwide. Every year, during the arrival of spring, Holi brings together people from all walks of life to celebrate love, harmony, and the victory of good over evil. The festival typically lasts for two days, with the first day marking the celebration of the triumph of good, symbolized by the burning of Holika, while the second day is dedicated to throwing and smearing vibrant colors at one another in a spirit of fun and unity.

The festival has deep cultural and spiritual significance, with roots in ancient Hindu traditions and mythologies. It is a time for families and communities to come together, put aside their differences, and revel in the joy of togetherness, music, dance, and, of course, colors.

Some local hidden gems in India where Holi is celebrated in unique ways include:

- Mathura and Vrindavan: Considered the birthplace of Lord Krishna, Mathura and Vrindavan are famous for their spectacular Holi celebrations. Devotees gather in temples and streets, singing devotional songs, and playing Holi with flowers and colors. The festivities last several days, with Vrindavan offering a special "Lathmar Holi," where women playfully hit men with sticks while they throw colors.
- Jaipur: The capital of Rajasthan, Jaipur, hosts an extravagant Holi celebration, where the royal family and locals come together to celebrate with traditional dances, music, and, of course, the throwing of colors. The event at the palace, where people gather for a grand celebration, is a sight to behold.
- Shantiniketan: For a quieter, more artistic take on Holi, head to Shantiniketan in West Bengal. Here, the famous poet Rabindranath Tagore's university holds a cultural celebration, with students performing songs, dances, and poetry. The Holi celebrations here focus on artistic expression and have a more subdued but deeply meaningful atmosphere.
- Barsana (Lathmar Holi): Lathmar Holi in Barsana, Uttar Pradesh, is a special tradition where women playfully beat men with sticks as they attempt to throw colors. The men, who are dressed in traditional attire, defend themselves with shields. This unique and energetic celebration draws visitors from all over India and beyond.
- Anandpur Sahib (Holi in Punjab): In the city of Anandpur Sahib, the celebrations are especially vibrant, reflecting the regionâ€™s Sikh heritage. The festival includes singing, dancing, and a grand procession, along with the throwing of colors. The Holi celebrations here blend cultural and religious traditions, making it a unique experience for visitors.
